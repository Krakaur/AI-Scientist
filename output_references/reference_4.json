In this way, this research aimed to discuss the main challenges and methodological limitations found in the use of SI, emphasizing the main fragilities identified in the literature. In methodological terms, the research has exploratory characteristics, supported by the mixed methods approach using a theoretical-empirical analysis, from the available literature on the subject and the methodologies used and the experience of researchers about the topic addressed. The main results demonstrated that Sustainability Indicators are tools that should be used to define, implement, evaluate and monitor public policies at all levels, considering the potentialities/weaknesses and priorities of each context.",
