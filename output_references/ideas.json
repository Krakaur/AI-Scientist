To extract relevant information from sustainability reports, 51 sustainability indicators of practices were compiled from the literature and reporting guidelines on sustainability. These indicators were then scored for 331 companies based on the content of their sustainability reports. A factor analysis carried out on these indicators yielded five constructs: three for environmental sustainability and two for social sustainability. Bloomberg's environmental and social governance (ESG) ratings and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DSJI), which use private and public information from companies, served as proxies for actual sustainability performance. Upon testing, the constructs developed from the sustainability reports were found to explain the DJSI and ESG measures of sustainability significantly. Therefore, sustainability reports appear to indicate actual sustainability performance.",

Supermarkets hold a powerful position within the food system, and one source of power is supermarket own brand foods (SOBFs). Many of the world\u2019s largest supermarkets have corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies that can impact public health, but little is known about their quality or practical application. This study examines the nature and quality of Australian supermarkets\u2019 CSR policies that can impact public health nutrition, and provides evidence of practical applications for SOBFs. A content analysis of CSR policies was conducted. Evidence of supermarkets putting CSR policies into practice was derived from observational audits of 3940 SOBFs in three large exemplar supermarkets (Coles, Woolworths, IGA) in Perth, Western Australia (WA). All supermarkets had some CSR policies that could impact public health nutrition; however, over half related to sustainability, and many lacked specificity. All supermarkets sold some nutritious SOBFs, using marketing techniques that made them visible. Findings suggest Australian supermarket CSR policies are not likely to adequately contribute to improving population diets or sustainability of food systems. Setting robust and meaningful targets, and improving transparency and specificity of CSR policies, would improve the nature and quality of supermarket CSR policies and increase the likelihood of a public health benefit.",

The main objective of this study is to present a bibliometric analysis of about thirty years of research on urban sustainability assessment. The literature database includes 3877 articles published in the Web of Science. VOSviewer and SciMAT are two science mapping software tools that were utilized for this purpose. VOSviewer is utilized to detect major focus areas and to identify influential authors, publications, and journals using various network analysis techniques such as term co-occurrence, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling. Also, SciMAT is used to understand how the intellectual base of the field has evolved over time and what are the major themes that have contributed to this evolution. For this purpose, the study interval was divided into four sub-periods (i.e., 1991\u20132000; 2001\u20132009; 2010\u20132015; and 2016\u20132020). Results show that this field has initially been mainly focused on few themes but has later become more diversified to acknowledge the multi-dimensional characteristics of urban sustainability. Despite this, environmental aspects are still dominant and major socio-economic issues such as equity, justice, and public engagement are not well represented. Sustainable development indicators, energy, green infrastructure, water, land use, and urban design are major thematic areas, with the first three playing more important roles in structuring the development of the field.

        "abstract": "Purpose: The implementation of sustainability and circular economy (CE) models in agri-food production can promote resource efficiency, reduce environmental burdens, and ensure improved and socially responsible systems. In this context, indicators for the measurement of sustainability play a crucial role. Indicators can measure CE strategies aimed to preserve functions, products, components, materials, or embodied energy. Although there is broad literature describing sustainability and CE indicators, no study offers such a comprehensive framework of indicators for measuring sustainability and CE in the agri-food sector. Methods: Starting from this central research gap, a systematic literature review has been developed to measure the sustainability in the agri-food sector and, based on these findings, to understand how indicators are used and for which specific purposes. Results: The analysis of the results allowed us to classify the sample of articles in three main clusters (\u201cAssessment-LCA,\u201d \u201cBest practice,\u201d and \u201cDecision-making\u201d) and has shown increasing attention to the three pillars of sustainability (triple bottom line).

Sometimes, this concept is only partially defined, including just low costs, profit maximization and/or CO2 emission reduction. Actually, a process or material can be defined as sustainable only if an objective function related to the economic, environmental and social impacts is simultaneously maximized. To this aim, it is necessary to define appropriate and specific sustainability indicators (i.e., values related to the economic, social and environmental aspects of a process or material under analysis). These indicators come about from simple calculations, and they are defined in terms of percentages and represented and compared using radar diagrams. Then, a process or specific material is identified by an objective function (i.e., the area included by the polygon that links the scores reported on the diagram). The scope of this representation of data is to individuate the major weaknesses of the process/material, proposing methods of optimization and trying to maximize the objective function in the retrieved diagram. This work aims to propose a general and simple method to calculate sustainability indicators on the basis of specific definitions related to a given process/material. To highlight the potential of this calculation and comparison instrument, two case studies are proposed: the first aims at comparing processes for the production of energy, while the second aims at driving the choice of manufacturing material. The selected indicators and adopted algorithm allowed for the identification of hydroelectric and eolic as the most sustainable processes for energy production; for materials, the results strictly depended on the assumptions made regarding favorable mechanical properties.",

To attain the consensually established targets in the SDG framework, it is vital to assess the impact of CE practices. As most of these practices are carried out in a network of actors, sustainability assessment approaches from the fields of industrial ecology and supply chain management are particularly suitable. However, both fields are known for their limited inclusion of the social dimension. While scholars have already started to explore the assessment of social sustainability within the context of CE practices, little is known about the perspectives and experiences concerning social assessment of businesses actively involved with CE. Thus, the authors conducted 43 semi-structured interviews with frontrunner companies engaged with CE in Italy and the Netherlands to obtain a better picture of (1) how these firms view the importance of the social dimension as part of the assessment of CE practices, (2) what the barriers to conducting social assessment are, and (3) whether they have experience with assessing social sustainability aspects within their companies and supply chains. Through a thematic analysis, it was found that most companies deem the social dimension to be relevant to CE assessment and either consider it an integral part of CE or of sustainability. However, a majority of the firms did not conduct any type of social assessment.

The well-being of cities and their expansion were measured by the road networks that linked them to the rest of the world, especially the land roads, which were the biggest challenges for communities. With time, the transportation sector has become an integral part of human life. However, this contribution to the development of cities has come to collide with the challenges arising from the means of transportation, which include large-scale environmental, economic, and social impacts on the communities benefiting from them. Therefore, it has become necessary to make transportation, especially public transportation, sustainable to address environmental challenges such as climate change. To achieve this, more than two thousand research papers published between 2002 and 2022 and retrieved from scientific databases using specific and connected keywords were preliminarily investigated based on the year and number of citations.

The objective of this review is to provide a bibliometric analysis of sustainability pillars and indicators that are significantly prevalent. In addition, this paper evaluates the impact of pillars and indicators on scientific research through the analysis of their citation and trend. Using Scopus database, a total of 30 articles related to crops farming have been selected and more than 500 indicators were analyzed. This study only looked at the top 3 indicators of each pillar which were discussed in at least 7 articles and can be used to measure farm sustainability in different crop production fields: (soil erosion, crop diversity and pesticides) for the environmental pillar, (education and training) for the social pillar, and (profitability, productivity and farm income) for the economic pillar. Results also showed that the environmental pillar is the most tackled and cited with a mean citation of about 60. Pesticides on the other hand is found to be the oldest indicator in terms of its average year of publication. It was the most cited indicator in 2005 of more than 250 citations. The least cited indicators are farm income and training with less than 10 mean citations. In addition, the economic pillar is considered one of the recently discussed and widely implemented with a total of 7 published articles in 2020. The obtained results may be viewed as a set of indicators that can be considered in future policies to detect significant challenges, and improve agricultural sustainability strategies.",

These difficulties arise when measurements from different disciplines need to be combined to quantify an attribute for an object of study. Sustainability is a fuzzy concept measured as an attribute of many different objects. Sustainability measurements are often a composition of environmental, economic and social sustainability measurements, which makes them interdisciplinary composite measurements. The present study aims to advance interdisciplinary sustainability research by a systematic review of the interdisciplinary measurement of the attribute sustainability using the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework and to investigate whether measurement issues differ between the environmental, economic and social dimension. A systematic literature review was done based on a query, on Web of Science, that reflected the interdisciplinarity of sustainability science and the TBL framework. Abstracts were scanned for relevance and papers that passed the scan were downloaded and scrutinized for their measurement characteristics such as measurement level, aggregation of scores into composite measurements, and weighting methods. An iterative coding approach (top-down and bottom-up) was used until saturation was reached. The search returned 467 papers, of which 77 contained sufficiently detailed information on the interdisciplinary measurement of sustainability, following the TBL framework. Not all papers in the final set contained sufficiently detailed information on the performed measurements, and if and how the distinct dimensions were combined into one interdisciplinary sustainability measurement. The 86 reported measurement models of sustainability were heterogeneous with respect to measurement levels used, the use of composite scores, weighting schemes and time synchronization between indicators. Two thirds of the measurement models presented composite scores of the attribute sustainability. The weights used in composite scores were in most cases determined using experts\u2019 opinions.

        "abstract": "Sustainable development is a multi-dimensional concept, which emphasizes integration and striking a dynamic balance between economic, social and environmental aspects in a region, to ensure inter-generational and intra-generational equity. One of the major tools to address sustainability concerns is to have indices, which can measure the performance of a region on various dimensions of sustainable development. The review suggests there are various indices that are available at the global scale that compare different countries on different aspects of sustainability; however, a limited number of studies have been reported at regional scale. Further, the paper appraises about the various approaches and frameworks used to develop these Sustainable Development Indices (SDIs). The merits and demerits of these approaches and frameworks have been discussed. The review finds that top-down approaches have been generally employed for construction of SDIs. However, bottom-up approaches which are rarely used, also need to be developed in order to construct robust, contextual and consensus based SDIs. The review shows that composite SDIs are the most common form of framework used across the globe. Most studies have been found to use 30\u201360 indicators for development of SDIs. The key steps to be followed for construction of Composite Sustainable Development Indices (CSDIs) have been reviewed in detail. The review finds variable processes and steps followed by different studies for development of SDIs. Based on the review, research gaps have been identified and recommendations on steps to be followed in construction of new CSDI have been provided. The review also reveals that most studies have focused on assessment of current state of sustainable development, a limited number where the trends have been studies; no study related to the future projections/predictions of the SDI has been reported in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Today, the centrality of cities in the global sustainability challenge is widely acknowledged, and numerous initiatives have been developed worldwide for monitoring and comparing the sustainability performance of urban areas. However, the escalating abundance of indicators makes it difficult to understand what really counts in urban sustainability and how to properly select the most suitable indicators. By methodically collecting and mapping the diversity of available indicators, our work aims to elucidate the emphases, as well as the gaps, that exist in the way urban sustainability is currently translated into metrics, and to draw instructive lessons to support the development of future indicator sets. Representing the most comprehensive study ever performed in the field, this analysis relies on both an innovative research approach entailing multi- and cross-typological systematic analysis of indicators and an extensive data sample comprising 67 indicator sets (for a total of 2847 indicators) from academia and practice. The findings highlight the most frequent indicators in urban sustainability measurement initiatives, and demonstrate the prominence of social issues (e.g., quality of life, access to services, consumer behaviour, employment) and to a lesser extent, of environmental stakes. In contrast, urban sustainability indicator sets generally pay marginal attention to political questions (e.g., participation, policies, institutional settings), gender issues and distributional concerns. From a systemic point of view, the analysis reveals the strong emphasis placed on the status of actual and potential resources as well as the satisfaction of current needs. The study further highlights seven key lessons on how to deal with three typical tensions faced during indicator selection processes: (i) parsimony vs. comprehensiveness; (ii) context-specificity vs. general comparability; and (iii) complexity vs. simplicity. The directly implementable recommendations proposed herein will support both scholars and practitioners in the design of future urban sustainability measurement initiatives.",

        "abstract": "The measurement of sustainability within industrial supply chains is becoming increasingly relevant, with both industry and academia calling for the development of a general and manageable set of key performance indicators (KPIs). With more than 2,000 performance measures already identified by the previous literature, the real challenge lays in the development of the right set of indicators. Stemming from a thorough literature review, we propose a novel set of KPIs, based on a Balance Score Card - Supply Chain Operations Reference integrated framework. Whilst including a limited number of KPIs, the proposed set: i) assures a balanced coverage of the sustainability pillars and related intersections; ii) addresses different decision-making levels, financial bases and components of performance; iii) simultaneously tackles the sustainability performance of an entire supply chain. We empirically validated the set in 3 supply chains and 7 focal firms, by assessing its completeness, usefulness and ease of use. The set resulted suitable for different contexts of application and appropriate for the evaluation of the sustainability performance of an overall supply chain. We conclude with remarks for academia, industry and policy-makers, also sketching directions for further research.",

In this paper, we have identified sustainability indicators for IS using previous theoretical frameworks where universal design (UD) and its advance concept were used.

        "abstract": "The growing interest for Circular Economy (CE) urged experts to develop assessment metrics regarding the shift from a linear to a circular rationale. As a response, the recent literature has been populated with a plethora of circularity indicators addressing different CE scales: nano (products), micro (companies), meso (industrial symbiosis), and macro (governments). However, simply shifting to circular systems does not necessarily result in favorable alternatives, as trade-offs may occur concerning environmental, economic, or social impacts. In order to assist decision-makers in the processes of choosing the best-suiting indicator for circularity assessments, this study presents a systematic literature review aiming at nano- and micro-level indicators, which were evaluated according to their relation to the sustainability pillars and life cycle stages (take, make, use, recover). Sixty-one publications were analyzed (44 peer-reviewed, 16 from gray literature, 1 dissertation). Fifty-eight indicators were explored (38 nano, 14 micro, 6 directed to both levels). Findings show that the majority of metrics are nano-level environmentally-driven indicators that focus on material and resource recovery strategies. A second expressive group is simultaneously focused on the environmental and economic pillars. Social repercussions are rarely addressed. We argue that the analyzed indicators mainly focus on material and resource recirculation and lack robustness to assess the sustainability performance of circular systems. Future research could analyze the integration of the investigated indicators with consolidated methodologies to overcome the barrier of combining circularity and sustainability performance.",

Also, the analytical power and simplicity of the analysis are less suited to assessing social and ecological impacts. Therefore, ecological impacts and other human-centred impacts of CCs are neglected, leaving more difficult problems for the assessment robustness to assess the sustainability performance of circular systems.

        "abstract": "Introduction: Diets are currently unsustainable in many countries as evidenced by the growing burden of malnutrition, degradation of natural resources, contributions to climate change, and unaffordability of healthy diets. Agreement on what constitutes a healthy and sustainable diet has been debated. In 2019, FAO and WHO published the Sustainable Healthy Diets Guiding Principles, defining what qualifies as a sustainable healthy diet. While valuable, these principles require measurable indicators to support their operationalization. Our scoping review aims to describe how sustainable healthy diets have been assessed in the literature since 2010. Methods: A search for English-language articles published in peer-reviewed journals was conducted from January 2010 through February 2020 across three databases. Out of the 504 articles initially identified, 103 articles were included. Metadata were extracted from each article on: publication year, country of study, study aims, methods, main data sources, indicators used to assess sustainable healthy diets, reported indicator strengths or limitations, and main study findings. A qualitative content analysis identified major conceptual themes across indicators and their frequency of use. Findings: From the 103 empirical articles included in our review, 57.3% were published after 2017. Most studies were carried out in high-income countries (74%). Approximately 42% of the articles assessed the sustainability of diets using solely health and environmental indicators; <25% assessed the sustainability of diets across health, environmental, and sociocultural aspects of sustainability. We found a substantial number of unique indicators used for assessing health (n = 82), environmental (n = 117), and sociocultural (n = 43) aspects of diets. These indicators covered concepts related to health outcomes, aspects of diet quality, natural resources, climate change, cultural acceptability, and cost of diets. The preponderance of indicators currently used in research likely poses challenges for stakeholders to identify the most appropriate measures. Conclusion: Robust indicators for sustainable healthy diets are critical for understanding trends, setting targets, and monitoring progress across national and sub-national levels.

Currently, there is an urgent need to form a long-term sustainable investment mechanism for screening, evaluation, and promotion of appropriate green technology. Therefore, this study develops an integrated green technology framework to fill a gap in the literature by prioritizing green technologies' most critical attributes in Pakistan. Initially, we focus on eight leading green technology indicators: Environmental Quality, Resource Utilization, Agriculture & forestry, Green building, Energy utilization, Green Transport, Life Health, and Ecology Safety with the help of the fuzzy Delphi method. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is employed to find primary and sub-indicators relative importance. Results reveal that Energy Utilization and agriculture & forestry are significant indicators. Supply chain and sustainable food security, Energy Recycling and Eco-Farming obtained the highest weight scores and are seen as essential among 43 sub-criteria. This study is among the first to assess the green technology indicators for cleaner production and sustainable investment to achieve sustainable development. This study's outcomes can help scholars, managers, government agencies, and decision-makers understand the importance of green technologies to achieve SDGs while simultaneously improving sustainability practices.",

This study is among the first to assess the green technology indicators for cleaner production and sustainable investment to achieve sustainable development. This study's outcomes can help scholars, managers, government agencies, and decision-makers understand the importance of a green innovation. With the involvement of some of the most prominent green innovation teams in the field, this effort, along with the cooperation of a number of stakeholders, can improve the transparency of the green technology indicators. A more holistic approach has been of green technologies to achieve SDGs while simultaneously improving sustainability practices.\n\nGrowth is driven by the overall level of capital (including capital invested in the system), and while the system is being managed, the growing size of its user base, at a price that makes it difficult for most people to be connected to"
