        "abstract": "This study investigates whether sustainability reports indicate corporate sustainability performance\u2014in other words, the extent to which such disclosure is informative. To extract relevant information from sustainability reports, 51 sustainability indicators of practices were compiled from the literature and reporting guidelines on sustainability. These indicators were then scored for 331 companies based on the content of their sustainability reports. A factor analysis carried out on these indicators yielded five constructs: three for environmental sustainability and two for social sustainability. Bloomberg's environmental and social governance (ESG) ratings and Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DSJI), which use private and public information from companies, served as proxies for actual sustainability performance. Upon testing, the constructs developed from the sustainability reports were found to explain the DJSI and ESG measures of sustainability significantly. Therefore, sustainability reports appear to indicate actual sustainability performance.",

        "abstract": "Improving population diets is a public health priority, and calls have been made for corporations such as supermarkets to contribute. Supermarkets hold a powerful position within the food system, and one source of power is supermarket own brand foods (SOBFs). Many of the world\u2019s largest supermarkets have corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies that can impact public health, but little is known about their quality or practical application. This study examines the nature and quality of Australian supermarkets\u2019 CSR policies that can impact public health nutrition, and provides evidence of practical applications for SOBFs. A content analysis of CSR policies was conducted. Evidence of supermarkets putting CSR policies into practice was derived from observational audits of 3940 SOBFs in three large exemplar supermarkets (Coles, Woolworths, IGA) in Perth, Western Australia (WA). All supermarkets had some CSR policies that could impact public health nutrition; however, over half related to sustainability, and many lacked specificity. All supermarkets sold some nutritious SOBFs, using marketing techniques that made them visible. Findings suggest Australian supermarket CSR policies are not likely to adequately contribute to improving population diets or sustainability of food systems. Setting robust and meaningful targets, and improving transparency and specificity of CSR policies, would improve the nature and quality of supermarket CSR policies and increase the likelihood of a public health benefit.",

Su aplicaci\u00f3n permite apreciar diferencias entre las tres ciudades: un mayor \u00e9nfasis en la gobernanza y menos \u00e9xito en la equidad social, en el caso de Santiago; mayor esfuerzo en la equidad y menos \u00e9xito en la habitabilidad y la gobernanza, en Bogot\u00e1; una relaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s equilibrada pero levemente m\u00e1s d\u00e9bil en equidad y gobernanza, en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico. ABSTRACT Analyzing three Latin American megacities-Bogot\u00e1, Mexico City and Santiago de Chile and more contemporary approaches used in the study of sustainability assessment methodology proposed sustainability indicators approach incorporating third generation (G3 \u00b0). Build a Metropolitan Urban Sustainability Index (ISUM) including social aspects (grouped under the term of equity), economic (competitiveness), environmental (habitability) and institutional (Governance). The ISUM proved to be reliable and sensitive enough to account for the dynamics of sustainability issues in the metropolis. Its application allows to appreciate differences between the three cities: a greater emphasis on governance and less successful social equity, in the case of Santiago; greater effort on equity and less successful in livability and governance, in Bogota; more balanced but slightly weaker in equity and governance in Mexico City for a relationship.",

        "abstract": "Circular Economy is the optimal point of sustainability, given that it offers a set of practices capable of generating more sustainable operations, making sustainability feasible in organizations. To measure the innovations brought by Circular Economy, there is a recent need to develop circularity indicators, mainly for micro level (companies and products). Furthermore, the complexity of Circular Economy implies in a set of multi-dimensional indicators instead of a single one. This paper aims to develop a set of indicators linking Circular Economy principles, Circular Business Model and the pillars of Sustainability. The set of indicators was developed based in the hypothetic-deductive approach, following a number of iterations (cycles) and testing the theory in the empirical world. A mix of research methods (e.g. expert consulting, user's feedback, and case studies) was applied. The proposed indicators should be able to achieve the principles of the Circular Economy, and, at the same time, help to meet the specificities and needs of each circular business model. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a group of indicators, focused in the three dimensions of Sustainability (environmental (from material perspective), economic and social), applied in Circular Business Models to capture the innovations brought by Circular Economy that conventional indicators do not measure. Moreover, they will help any company to identify areas with high importance and potential for improvement, and thus increase Circular Economy performance in an efficient, clear and prompt manner. These indicators were applied in three Brazilian companies which have three different Circular Business Models. The results show that data from economic and social dimensions was not available or was diffused in the companies. It represents a barrier because most of the positive impacts gained with Circular Economy are presented in the social dimension, including job creation, mindset change, etc.",

        "abstract": "Following the recognition of the significance of urban areas for achieving sustainable development in the late 1980\u2032s, first studies on \u2018urban sustainability assessment\u2019 were published in early 1990s. Since then, the field has grown rapidly, with over 300 papers published annually in recent years. The main objective of this study is to present a bibliometric analysis of about thirty years of research on urban sustainability assessment. The literature database includes 3877 articles published in the Web of Science. VOSviewer and SciMAT are two science mapping software tools that were utilized for this purpose. VOSviewer is utilized to detect major focus areas and to identify influential authors, publications, and journals using various network analysis techniques such as term co-occurrence, co-citation, and bibliographic coupling. Also, SciMAT is used to understand how the intellectual base of the field has evolved over time and what are the major themes that have contributed to this evolution. For this purpose, the study interval was divided into four sub-periods (i.e., 1991\u20132000; 2001\u20132009; 2010\u20132015; and 2016\u20132020). Results show that this field has initially been mainly focused on few themes but has later become more diversified to acknowledge the multi-dimensional characteristics of urban sustainability. Despite this, environmental aspects are still dominant and major socio-economic issues such as equity, justice, and public engagement are not well represented. Sustainable development indicators, energy, green infrastructure, water, land use, and urban design are major thematic areas, with the first three playing more important roles in structuring the development of the field. This study can be used as a point of reference for those interested in gaining more knowledge about urban sustainability assessment and its evolution.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: The implementation of sustainability and circular economy (CE) models in agri-food production can promote resource efficiency, reduce environmental burdens, and ensure improved and socially responsible systems. In this context, indicators for the measurement of sustainability play a crucial role. Indicators can measure CE strategies aimed to preserve functions, products, components, materials, or embodied energy. Although there is broad literature describing sustainability and CE indicators, no study offers such a comprehensive framework of indicators for measuring sustainability and CE in the agri-food sector. Methods: Starting from this central research gap, a systematic literature review has been developed to measure the sustainability in the agri-food sector and, based on these findings, to understand how indicators are used and for which specific purposes. Results: The analysis of the results allowed us to classify the sample of articles in three main clusters (\u201cAssessment-LCA,\u201d \u201cBest practice,\u201d and \u201cDecision-making\u201d) and has shown increasing attention to the three pillars of sustainability (triple bottom line). In this context, an integrated approach of indicators (environmental, social, and economic) offers the best solution to ensure an easier transition to sustainability. Conclusions: The sample analysis facilitated the identification of new categories of impact that deserve attention, such as the cooperation among stakeholders in the supply chain and eco-innovation.",

        "abstract": "The concept of sustainability is nowadays employed to compare manufacturing processes or to define the correct path for material selection. Sometimes, this concept is only partially defined, including just low costs, profit maximization and/or CO2 emission reduction. Actually, a process or material can be defined as sustainable only if an objective function related to the economic, environmental and social impacts is simultaneously maximized. To this aim, it is necessary to define appropriate and specific sustainability indicators (i.e., values related to the economic, social and environmental aspects of a process or material under analysis). These indicators come about from simple calculations, and they are defined in terms of percentages and represented and compared using radar diagrams. Then, a process or specific material is identified by an objective function (i.e., the area included by the polygon that links the scores reported on the diagram). The scope of this representation of data is to individuate the major weaknesses of the process/material, proposing methods of optimization and trying to maximize the objective function in the retrieved diagram. This work aims to propose a general and simple method to calculate sustainability indicators on the basis of specific definitions related to a given process/material. To highlight the potential of this calculation and comparison instrument, two case studies are proposed: the first aims at comparing processes for the production of energy, while the second aims at driving the choice of manufacturing material. The selected indicators and adopted algorithm allowed for the identification of hydroelectric and eolic as the most sustainable processes for energy production; for materials, the results strictly depended on the assumptions made regarding favorable mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "Despite the frequent association of circular economy (CE) with sustainability, most CE practices have yet to prove they actually contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and social aspects in particular. To attain the consensually established targets in the SDG framework, it is vital to assess the impact of CE practices. As most of these practices are carried out in a network of actors, sustainability assessment approaches from the fields of industrial ecology and supply chain management are particularly suitable. However, both fields are known for their limited inclusion of the social dimension. While scholars have already started to explore the assessment of social sustainability within the context of CE practices, little is known about the perspectives and experiences concerning social assessment of businesses actively involved with CE. Thus, the authors conducted 43 semi-structured interviews with frontrunner companies engaged with CE in Italy and the Netherlands to obtain a better picture of (1) how these firms view the importance of the social dimension as part of the assessment of CE practices, (2) what the barriers to conducting social assessment are, and (3) whether they have experience with assessing social sustainability aspects within their companies and supply chains. Through a thematic analysis, it was found that most companies deem the social dimension to be relevant to CE assessment and either consider it an integral part of CE or of sustainability. However, a majority of the firms did not conduct any type of social assessment. Most companies which implemented assessments did so in a qualitative manner or used industry-based sustainability indicator frameworks. Notwithstanding the prevalence of social life cycle assessment in the academic realm, almost all interviewees mentioned barriers to its application related to its complexity and the lack of a standardised approach.",
