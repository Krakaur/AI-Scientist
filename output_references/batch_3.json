        "abstract": "This paper aims at developing and applying an indicators system for smart tourism destinations in order to better understand the current situation of a set of destinations which are developing smart tourism policies. The indicators were developed by adapting existing indicators in tourism destination management and smart cities literature, creating a new system based on a smart destination theoretical model that establishes three interrelated levels in which smart destinations are grounded: strategic-relational, instrumental and applied levels. Within these levels, nine different dimensions to be measured were identified. The indicators were constructed in collaboration with a public organisation (INVAT.TUR) devoted to providing technical assistance to smart destinations and were pre-tested, readjusted and then applied to a set of destinations of the Region of Valencia (Spain). Obtained findings reveal an uneven performance of destinations in the different dimensions of the three levels. A notable performance is observed in indicators for connectivity and online marketing, while more efforts need to be done in accessibility and sustainability initiatives. However, disparities are evident between different indicators and destinations. These results are discussed and framed within the relevant literature on smart destinations while providing information for destination managers and policy makers to adapt and replicate these indicators in their own territories. This paper is a first attempt to develop and apply indicators to measure smart destinations progress in literature and therefore constitutes an important precedent for future studies.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with developing an indicator system for monitoring, analyzing, and assessing sustainability of airports. The sustainability implies simultaneous increasing of the overall social-economic benefits and increasing at a slower rate, stagnating, and/or diminishing of the negative impacts of these airports during the specified medium-to long-term period of time. The indicator system consists of the indicators and their measures reflecting the airport operational, economic, social, and environmental dimension of performances. These include effects-benefits and impacts-externalities of the airport operations. The effects-benefits include mainly the airport contribution to local employment, regional (local) economy, and consequently GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The impacts-externalities embrace local noise, air pollution, congestion and delays, land use (take), and waste. The particular indicators and their measures are specified respecting interests and attitudes of particular actors involved such as users and providers of air transport services, private and public investors, governmental organizations, local community members, lobbies and pressure groups, and general public. An application of the proposed indicator system has shown that it could be considered as an initial step in developing a \"tool\" for assessing the current and prospective level of the airport sustainable development.",

        "abstract": "The EU\u2019s 2018 Bioeconomy Strategy Update and the European Green Deal recently confirmed that the bioeconomy is high on the political agenda in Europe. Here, we propose a conceptual analysis framework for quantifying and analyzing the development of the EU bioeconomy. The bioeconomy has several related concepts (e.g., bio-based economy, green economy, and circular economy) and there are clear synergies between these concepts, especially between the bioeconomy and circular economy concepts. Analyzing the driving factors provides important information for monitoring activities. We first derive the scope of the bioeconomy framework in terms of bioeconomy sectors and products to be involved, the needed geographical coverage and resolution, and time period. Furthermore, we outline a set of indicators linked to the objectives of the EU\u2019s bioeconomy strategy. In our framework, measuring developments will, in particular, focus on the bio-based sectors within the bioeconomy as biomass and food production is already monitored. The selected indicators commit to the EU Bioeconomy Strategy objectives and conform with findings from previous studies and stakeholder consultation. Additionally, several new indicators have been suggested and they are related to measuring the impact of changes in supply, demand drivers, resource availability, and policies on sustainability goals.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable development is a multi-dimensional concept, which emphasizes integration and striking a dynamic balance between economic, social and environmental aspects in a region, to ensure inter-generational and intra-generational equity. One of the major tools to address sustainability concerns is to have indices, which can measure the performance of a region on various dimensions of sustainable development. The review suggests there are various indices that are available at the global scale that compare different countries on different aspects of sustainability; however, a limited number of studies have been reported at regional scale. Further, the paper appraises about the various approaches and frameworks used to develop these Sustainable Development Indices (SDIs). The merits and demerits of these approaches and frameworks have been discussed. The review finds that top-down approaches have been generally employed for construction of SDIs. However, bottom-up approaches which are rarely used, also need to be developed in order to construct robust, contextual and consensus based SDIs. The review shows that composite SDIs are the most common form of framework used across the globe. Most studies have been found to use 30\u201360 indicators for development of SDIs. The key steps to be followed for construction of Composite Sustainable Development Indices (CSDIs) have been reviewed in detail. The review finds variable processes and steps followed by different studies for development of SDIs. Based on the review, research gaps have been identified and recommendations on steps to be followed in construction of new CSDI have been provided. The review also reveals that most studies have focused on assessment of current state of sustainable development, a limited number where the trends have been studies; no study related to the future projections/predictions of the SDI has been reported in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Today, the centrality of cities in the global sustainability challenge is widely acknowledged, and numerous initiatives have been developed worldwide for monitoring and comparing the sustainability performance of urban areas. However, the escalating abundance of indicators makes it difficult to understand what really counts in urban sustainability and how to properly select the most suitable indicators. By methodically collecting and mapping the diversity of available indicators, our work aims to elucidate the emphases, as well as the gaps, that exist in the way urban sustainability is currently translated into metrics, and to draw instructive lessons to support the development of future indicator sets. Representing the most comprehensive study ever performed in the field, this analysis relies on both an innovative research approach entailing multi- and cross-typological systematic analysis of indicators and an extensive data sample comprising 67 indicator sets (for a total of 2847 indicators) from academia and practice. The findings highlight the most frequent indicators in urban sustainability measurement initiatives, and demonstrate the prominence of social issues (e.g., quality of life, access to services, consumer behaviour, employment) and to a lesser extent, of environmental stakes. In contrast, urban sustainability indicator sets generally pay marginal attention to political questions (e.g., participation, policies, institutional settings), gender issues and distributional concerns. From a systemic point of view, the analysis reveals the strong emphasis placed on the status of actual and potential resources as well as the satisfaction of current needs. The study further highlights seven key lessons on how to deal with three typical tensions faced during indicator selection processes: (i) parsimony vs. comprehensiveness; (ii) context-specificity vs. general comparability; and (iii) complexity vs. simplicity. The directly implementable recommendations proposed herein will support both scholars and practitioners in the design of future urban sustainability measurement initiatives.",

        "abstract": "The measurement of sustainability within industrial supply chains is becoming increasingly relevant, with both industry and academia calling for the development of a general and manageable set of key performance indicators (KPIs). With more than 2,000 performance measures already identified by the previous literature, the real challenge lays in the development of the right set of indicators. Stemming from a thorough literature review, we propose a novel set of KPIs, based on a Balance Score Card - Supply Chain Operations Reference integrated framework. Whilst including a limited number of KPIs, the proposed set: i) assures a balanced coverage of the sustainability pillars and related intersections; ii) addresses different decision-making levels, financial bases and components of performance; iii) simultaneously tackles the sustainability performance of an entire supply chain. We empirically validated the set in 3 supply chains and 7 focal firms, by assessing its completeness, usefulness and ease of use. The set resulted suitable for different contexts of application and appropriate for the evaluation of the sustainability performance of an overall supply chain. We conclude with remarks for academia, industry and policy-makers, also sketching directions for further research.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the importance of sustainability is persuading novel shifts in everyday life. This diversity makes it significant and challenging for sustainability to be quantified and measured. While the existence of perfect sustainability indicators is relatively unreasonable, they have important pragmatic roles in quantification and measurement by bridging sustainability's three pillars. Information system (IS) and sustainability are popular research areas, which clearly reflect the divergent and multidimensional role of sustainability. Despite this importance, defining the right sustainability indicators for IS is imperceptible. In this paper, we have identified sustainability indicators for IS using previous theoretical frameworks where universal design (UD) and its advance concept were used. Followed by this, a framework of IS sustainability indicators were proposed. The indicators were shown in the form of a design space arrangement, which could play significant roles in assessing sustainability for IS.",
