    "abstract": "Nowadays, the importance of sustainability is persuading novel shifts in everyday life. This diversity makes it significant and challenging for sustainability to be quantified and measured. While the existence of perfect sustainability indicators is relatively unreasonable, they have important pragmatic roles in quantification and measurement by bridging sustainability's three pillars. Information system (IS) and sustainability are popular research areas, which clearly reflect the divergent and multidimensional role of sustainability. Despite this importance, defining the right sustainability indicators for IS is imperceptible. In this paper, we have identified sustainability indicators for IS using previous theoretical frameworks where universal design (UD) and its advance concept were used. Followed by this, a framework of IS sustainability indicators were proposed. The indicators were shown in the form of a design space arrangement, which could play significant roles in assessing sustainability for IS.",
