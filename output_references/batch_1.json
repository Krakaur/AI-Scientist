        "abstract": "<p>Historically, roads and transportation have been critical and essential factors in the development and prosperity of cities and societies. The well-being of cities and their expansion were measured by the road networks that linked them to the rest of the world, especially the land roads, which were the biggest challenges for communities. With time, the transportation sector has become an integral part of human life. However, this contribution to the development of cities has come to collide with the challenges arising from the means of transportation, which include large-scale environmental, economic, and social impacts on the communities benefiting from them. Therefore, it has become necessary to make transportation, especially public transportation, sustainable to address environmental challenges such as climate change. To achieve this, more than two thousand research papers published between 2002 and 2022 and retrieved from scientific databases using specific and connected keywords were preliminarily investigated based on the year and number of citations. It was necessary to identify the important sustainability indicators for each sector and study them closely in a detailed manner. We concluded that the sustainability of public transportation is directly affected by environmental, economic, technical, and social factors which can be expressed as follows: 1\u2014emissions, pollution, and the consumption of energy resources as environmental indicators related to sustainability; 2\u2014travel time, cost, travel distance, and operation cost as economic indicators; 3\u2014social demographics, accessibility, and travel behaviours and time as social indicators; and 4\u2014traffic flow, speed, and availability of infrastructures as technical indicators that affect transport sustainability.</p>",

        "abstract": "Indicators are being used in many agricultural sustainability assessment methods, but disputes about a common indicator for the definition of sustainability have resulted in so many various indicators and methods of measurement. The objective of this review is to provide a bibliometric analysis of sustainability pillars and indicators that are significantly prevalent. In addition, this paper evaluates the impact of pillars and indicators on scientific research through the analysis of their citation and trend. Using Scopus database, a total of 30 articles related to crops farming have been selected and more than 500 indicators were analyzed. This study only looked at the top 3 indicators of each pillar which were discussed in at least 7 articles and can be used to measure farm sustainability in different crop production fields: (soil erosion, crop diversity and pesticides) for the environmental pillar, (education and training) for the social pillar, and (profitability, productivity and farm income) for the economic pillar. Results also showed that the environmental pillar is the most tackled and cited with a mean citation of about 60. Pesticides on the other hand is found to be the oldest indicator in terms of its average year of publication. It was the most cited indicator in 2005 of more than 250 citations. The least cited indicators are farm income and training with less than 10 mean citations. In addition, the economic pillar is considered one of the recently discussed and widely implemented with a total of 7 published articles in 2020. The obtained results may be viewed as a set of indicators that can be considered in future policies to detect significant challenges, and improve agricultural sustainability strategies.",

        "abstract": "Sustainability is a topic that has gained importance in several fields of knowledge, including the public, private and society spheres, based on the discussions that involve the definition of several public policies. Sustainability Indicators (SI) are metrics that seek to measure the level of sustainability and compile information for better decision-making concerning policies, programs, projects and actions related to sustainability. Demonstrated their relevance to public policies the SI appears as an essential tool for evaluating development goals as a sustainable proposal. In this way, this research aimed to discuss the main challenges and methodological limitations found in the use of SI, emphasizing the main fragilities identified in the literature. In methodological terms, the research has exploratory characteristics, supported by the mixed methods approach using a theoretical-empirical analysis, from the available literature on the subject and the methodologies used and the experience of researchers about the topic addressed. The main results demonstrated that Sustainability Indicators are tools that should be used to define, implement, evaluate and monitor public policies at all levels, considering the potentialities/weaknesses and priorities of each context.",

        "abstract": "A rapidly expanding field, sustainable agriculture aims to produce food and energy for people today and future generations. The sustainability concept is different in every field; thus, the indicators are unique in any area and country. Sustainable agriculture contains three main dimensions: economic, environmental, and social. Sustainable agriculture has been the focus of researchers for the past twenty-five years and has attracted much attention. Many researchers tried to identify these dimensions, but there is a lack of new research concerned with grouping all indicators together. Moreover, the indicators will change every year, so the indicators list needs to be frequently updated. This study follows the protocol for SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis) and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Web of Science (WoS) was used for the literature search. A total of 101 indicators were found from previous studies for the three dimensions: social, environment, economic. In order to measure the most important indicators for sustainable agriculture, the paper proposes an appropriate set of indicators, as well as providing the previous papers analyzed by year of publication, continent, and topic.",

        "abstract": "Measurement in interdisciplinary research can be difficult due to incompatibility of measures used in the different disciplines. These difficulties arise when measurements from different disciplines need to be combined to quantify an attribute for an object of study. Sustainability is a fuzzy concept measured as an attribute of many different objects. Sustainability measurements are often a composition of environmental, economic and social sustainability measurements, which makes them interdisciplinary composite measurements. The present study aims to advance interdisciplinary sustainability research by a systematic review of the interdisciplinary measurement of the attribute sustainability using the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework and to investigate whether measurement issues differ between the environmental, economic and social dimension. A systematic literature review was done based on a query, on Web of Science, that reflected the interdisciplinarity of sustainability science and the TBL framework. Abstracts were scanned for relevance and papers that passed the scan were downloaded and scrutinized for their measurement characteristics such as measurement level, aggregation of scores into composite measurements, and weighting methods. An iterative coding approach (top-down and bottom-up) was used until saturation was reached. The search returned 467 papers, of which 77 contained sufficiently detailed information on the interdisciplinary measurement of sustainability, following the TBL framework. Not all papers in the final set contained sufficiently detailed information on the performed measurements, and if and how the distinct dimensions were combined into one interdisciplinary sustainability measurement. The 86 reported measurement models of sustainability were heterogeneous with respect to measurement levels used, the use of composite scores, weighting schemes and time synchronization between indicators. Two thirds of the measurement models presented composite scores of the attribute sustainability. The weights used in composite scores were in most cases determined using experts\u2019 opinions. Albeit all included papers used the TBL as a framework, their measurement models do not form a coherent set. Fuzzy measurement practices occurred in all three dimensions of sustainability. On closer inspection, and wherever reports were sufficiently specific, interdisciplinary measurement models of sustainability turned out to be near-unique.",
