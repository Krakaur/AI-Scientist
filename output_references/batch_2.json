        "abstract": "The growing interest for Circular Economy (CE) urged experts to develop assessment metrics regarding the shift from a linear to a circular rationale. As a response, the recent literature has been populated with a plethora of circularity indicators addressing different CE scales: nano (products), micro (companies), meso (industrial symbiosis), and macro (governments). However, simply shifting to circular systems does not necessarily result in favorable alternatives, as trade-offs may occur concerning environmental, economic, or social impacts. In order to assist decision-makers in the processes of choosing the best-suiting indicator for circularity assessments, this study presents a systematic literature review aiming at nano- and micro-level indicators, which were evaluated according to their relation to the sustainability pillars and life cycle stages (take, make, use, recover). Sixty-one publications were analyzed (44 peer-reviewed, 16 from gray literature, 1 dissertation). Fifty-eight indicators were explored (38 nano, 14 micro, 6 directed to both levels). Findings show that the majority of metrics are nano-level environmentally-driven indicators that focus on material and resource recovery strategies. A second expressive group is simultaneously focused on the environmental and economic pillars. Social repercussions are rarely addressed. We argue that the analyzed indicators mainly focus on material and resource recirculation and lack robustness to assess the sustainability performance of circular systems. Future research could analyze the integration of the investigated indicators with consolidated methodologies to overcome the barrier of combining circularity and sustainability performance.",

        "abstract": "Sustainable energy development has become an international policy objective and an integral part of sustainable development. It is necessary to develop a robust and comprehensive set of indicators to monitor progress towards sustainable energy development. This analysis aimed to assess established indicator sets for sustainable energy development. The characteristics of a comprehensive and robust indicator set were identified to enable such an assessment and used as a basis for six assessment criteria; transparency of indicator selection and indicator application, conceptual framework, representative, linkages, and stakeholder engagement. A total of 57 indicator sets were found that monitor progress towards sustainable energy development or some aspects of it. All but one of these indicator sets were found to be lacking in some aspect, especially regarding a lack of transparency and consideration of linkages between indicators, presentation of an imbalanced picture, and no involvement of stakeholders during indicator development. The only indicator set that met all criteria were Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development developed jointly by multiple international agencies. Nonetheless, several flaws in this set were identified. The Energy Indicators for Sustainable Development could be considered as an initial basket of indicators for further refinement in the context where they will be applied to ensure their policy relevance and usefulness. The refinement process would benefit from more stakeholder input to take into account the specific context and make sure that there is a balance in the representation of the three dimensions of sustainable development.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to investigate the characteristics of a sustainable development assessment methodology being designed in the context of green technology. The methodology in question is based on indicators from the Sustainable Development Goals Index (SGDI), specifically in its ecological component. These indicators underlie an Averaging Sustainable Development Index (ASDI) and a Normalized Sustainable Development Index (NSDI). The resultant methodology was applied to 20 countries from the SDGI ranking. According to the research results, the intensive activity of the brown industries in the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, the United States, Korea, and Russia resulted in significant carbon dioxide emissions. Switzerland, Kazakhstan, and Russia had high scores on sustainable management of water and sanitation. Russia was the only developed country to have an ASDI higher than its SDGI and its gap between NSDI and ASDI indexes was not significant, indicating a positive trend in greentech development. The reason why NSDI was increasingly different from SDGI was that countries leading the socio-economic rankings had higher consumption of energy and resources, and a much greater environmental footprint than those countries that consumed less. The originality of this study is that it identifies gaps between NSDI and ASDI values, which indicate that conditions for greentech adoption in most developing countries are unfavorable.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Diets are currently unsustainable in many countries as evidenced by the growing burden of malnutrition, degradation of natural resources, contributions to climate change, and unaffordability of healthy diets. Agreement on what constitutes a healthy and sustainable diet has been debated. In 2019, FAO and WHO published the Sustainable Healthy Diets Guiding Principles, defining what qualifies as a sustainable healthy diet. While valuable, these principles require measurable indicators to support their operationalization. Our scoping review aims to describe how sustainable healthy diets have been assessed in the literature since 2010. Methods: A search for English-language articles published in peer-reviewed journals was conducted from January 2010 through February 2020 across three databases. Out of the 504 articles initially identified, 103 articles were included. Metadata were extracted from each article on: publication year, country of study, study aims, methods, main data sources, indicators used to assess sustainable healthy diets, reported indicator strengths or limitations, and main study findings. A qualitative content analysis identified major conceptual themes across indicators and their frequency of use. Findings: From the 103 empirical articles included in our review, 57.3% were published after 2017. Most studies were carried out in high-income countries (74%). Approximately 42% of the articles assessed the sustainability of diets using solely health and environmental indicators; <25% assessed the sustainability of diets across health, environmental, and sociocultural aspects of sustainability. We found a substantial number of unique indicators used for assessing health (n = 82), environmental (n = 117), and sociocultural (n = 43) aspects of diets. These indicators covered concepts related to health outcomes, aspects of diet quality, natural resources, climate change, cultural acceptability, and cost of diets. The preponderance of indicators currently used in research likely poses challenges for stakeholders to identify the most appropriate measures. Conclusion: Robust indicators for sustainable healthy diets are critical for understanding trends, setting targets, and monitoring progress across national and sub-national levels. Our review highlights the geographical imbalance, the narrow focus on health and environmental aspects, and the lack of common measures used in research. Measures registries could provide the decision-support needed by stakeholders to aid in the indicator selection process.",

        "abstract": "Comparative indicators, with which local governments monitor and evaluate policy progress, help effective implementation of public policy toward sustainable development (SD). However, such policy tools have been less developed at the local level. This study proposes conceptual frameworks of sustainable development indicators (SDIs) taking Japanese municipal governments as examples. The results illustrated five SDIs thereby indicating four approaches, and highlighted the most feasible and optimal frameworks. The former, supported by the vast majority of local governments, had a strong predilection for socioeconomic policies while disregarding environmental aspects despite their holistic aim, reflecting the current trend of sustainability at the local level in Japan. In contrast, the latter tended to encompass three dimensions of SD in a balanced manner, focusing largely on well-being. Hence, this framework helped complement the lack of environmental orientation and potentially maintain the consistency of public policy.",

        "abstract": "The United Nations proposed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to foster sustainable development, including tackling environmental challenges and adopting cleaner production practices worldwide. Green technology is crucial for the implementation of the SDGs. Currently, there is an urgent need to form a long-term sustainable investment mechanism for screening, evaluation, and promotion of appropriate green technology. Therefore, this study develops an integrated green technology framework to fill a gap in the literature by prioritizing green technologies' most critical attributes in Pakistan. Initially, we focus on eight leading green technology indicators: Environmental Quality, Resource Utilization, Agriculture & forestry, Green building, Energy utilization, Green Transport, Life Health, and Ecology Safety with the help of the fuzzy Delphi method. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is employed to find primary and sub-indicators relative importance. Results reveal that Energy Utilization and agriculture & forestry are significant indicators. Supply chain and sustainable food security, Energy Recycling and Eco-Farming obtained the highest weight scores and are seen as essential among 43 sub-criteria. This study is among the first to assess the green technology indicators for cleaner production and sustainable investment to achieve sustainable development. This study's outcomes can help scholars, managers, government agencies, and decision-makers understand the importance of green technologies to achieve SDGs while simultaneously improving sustainability practices.",
